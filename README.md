Slot Spin Master is a captivating Python-based slot machine simulation game designed to provide an engaging and realistic gambling experience without the risk of losing real money. Players start by depositing virtual funds and can then place bets on up to three lines, choosing their wager amounts within specified limits. The game features a 3x3 grid of symbols, including "A", "B", "C", and "D", each with different values and probabilities of appearing.

Upon spinning the reels, the symbols randomly align, and players win if matching symbols appear on the lines they have bet on. The game calculates the winnings based on the value of the symbols and the bet amount, providing immediate feedback on the results and updating the player's balance accordingly.
